Sure, I can help you with that. Here is a script for my video tutorial:

Hello, and welcome to my C++ tutorial for beginners. In this video, I will show you how to create a class and an 
object in C++, and how to access their attributes and methods.

A class is a user-defined data type that can contain data members and member functions. Data members are variables 
that store the state of an object, and member functions are functions that perform actions on the object. An object 
is an instance of a class, which means it has its own set of data members and member functions.

To create a class, we use the keyword class followed by the class name and a pair of curly braces. Inside the curly
 braces, we can declare the data members and member functions of the class. For example, let's create a class 
 called Car that has four data members: make, model, year, and color. 
 We can also declare two member functions: accelerate and brake, which will print some messages to the console.

class Car
{
private:
    /* data */
public:
    string make;
    string model;
    int year;
    string color;
    // methods
    void accelerate()
    {
        cout << "You step on the gas.\n";
    }
    void brake()
    {
        cout << "You step on the brake";
    }

}; // Car class ends here

Notice that we use the access specifier public before the data members and member functions. This means that they 
can be accessed from outside the class. If we use private instead, they can only be accessed from within the class
or by its friends. By default, all members of a class are private unless specified otherwise.

To create an object of a class, we use the class name followed by the object name. For example, let's create an 
object of Car called car1.

Car car1; // car1 is an unique identifier for the Car object

Now we can access the data members and member functions of car1 using the dot operator (.). For example, we can 
assign some values to the data members of car1 like this:

car1.make = "Ford";
car1.model = "Mustang";
car1.year = 2023;
car1.color = "silver";

We can also print the values of the data members using cout like this:

cout << "car1 make\t\t" << car1.make << "\n";
cout << "car1 model\t\t" << car1.model << "\n";
cout << "car1 year\t\t" << car1.year<< "\n";
cout << "car1 color\t\t" << car1.color << "\n";

And we can call the member functions of car1 like this:

car1.accelerate();
car1.brake();

This will produce the following output:

car1 make		Ford
car1 model		Mustang
car1 year		2023
car1 color		silver
You step on the gas.
You step on the brake

We can create multiple objects of the same class with different values for their data members. For example, we can
 create another object of Car called car2 and assign different values to its data members.

Car car2; // car2 is another identifier for the Car object
car2.make = "Toyota";
car2.model = "Corolla";
car2.year = 2020;
car2.color = "red";

We can then print the values of car2's data members and call its member functions as well.

cout << "car2 make\t\t" << car2.make << "\n";
cout << "car2 model\t\t" << car2.model << "\n";
cout << "car2 year\t\t" << car2.year<< "\n";
cout << "car2 color\t\t" << car2.color << "\n";

car2.accelerate();
car2.brake();

This will produce the following output:

car2 make		Toyota
car2 model		Corolla
car2 year		2020
car2 color		red
You step on the gas.
You step on the brake
